These are collections of javascript snippets that I use with many of my projects. Feel free to use them as well!

1) trim-function
	This function trims on both the left side and the right side

2) config-with-environment-detection
	Detect the environment and set config vars specific to that environment

3) browser-detect
	Detect the user's browser. Allows to know if certain functions / tools are available and potentially render elements differently
