These are collections of javascript snippets that I use with many of my projects. Feel free to use them as well!

1) trim-function
	This function trims on both the left side and the right side

2) config-with-environment-detection
	Detect the environment and set config vars specific to that environment

3) browser-detect
	Detect the user's browser. Allows to know if certain functions / tools are available and potentially render elements differently

4) interact-with-iframe
	Ever wanted to manipulate the elements of a page inside an iframe? Well it's possible! Load your iframe as usual and create an object referencing this iframe.
	
	Ex:
		$iframe = document.getElementById('myiframe');
		$iframe.contents().find( 'element to find - class or ID name' ).hide().show();

5) APP.js
	This file contains a master applications object that I have started using for a project I had. I stripped out all the proprietary information / references in this file and 
	left the barebones code.

	It has functions to get the viewport of the user's screen - great if you are trying to determine how big your modal window can be, etc...
	I left some logo update functions in there simply because they can be applied to various settings
	There is an alphanumeric input validator
	There is a message generator function. This function uses the language setting in the configuration file. A simple messages object would hold the english and french versions 
	of common messages - example "Welcome!", "Please wait...", etc... This was an attempt at adding language support to an application that consisted mostly of javascript and 
	JQuery code...hence reducing the backend calls via ajax.

	etc...

	Usage: 
	$APP.validate_input( $( '#input_field' ).val() );
	$APP.generateMessage( $app_messages['say_hello'] );	//Output: "Hello World!"
	$APP.find( '#my-element' );	//Same as $( '#my-element' ) except that this find method only  finds elements within an iframe, defined by $ide_iframe.
