Create-VHost is a PHP script used to create virtual hosts on a server. Instead of having to manually add subdomains and virtual hosts, the script can be excuted via PHP's EXECUTE function.

In the file is the barebones code needed to create the virtual host. This code was originally used as part of a function in a CakePHP Component - hence the references to Configure::read for certain options.

Feel free to customize this code as needed and implement in a function or class :-)
